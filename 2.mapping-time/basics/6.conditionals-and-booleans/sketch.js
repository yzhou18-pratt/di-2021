/*
A Boolean variable has only two possible values: true or false.
It is common to use Booleans with control statements to determine
the flow of a program.

In this example, when the boolean value "isLeft" is true, shapes
are drawn in black (otherwise they are white).

When "isUpper" is true, a circle is drawn (otherwise a square is)
